1) hhdemo.ipynb:  Produces the original Hodgkin Huxley Model
    
    This is the original model of the Hodgkin Huxley equations. It plots the Voltage, Current, Gating Value, and Injected current by time from 0-500 milliseconds. It uses 2 injected currents to fire the neuron and demonstrate it's reset. The first injected current is administered at 10 microamps for 100 milliseconds (100-200 milliseconds), and 350 microamps for 100 milliseconds (300-400 milliseconds)
    
2) initial_predictions.ipynb, contains the functions tested and used to improve on the Hodgkin-Huxely Neuron Model
